Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my corner of the internet.

#### Who am I?

I strongly believe my personal characteritics (gender, age, sex orientation, country of origin) should not be relevant for the quality of the content I am writing, and neither I want to disclaim them for safety reasons. I will only give details about me that I believe can somehow help people reading this to relate and to help them.

Since a young age I've been conflicted with the two very different perspectives of life: study, get a steady job and live a regular life (my initial plan was to study law and get a high paying job at the government and never have to think about it again) or risk myself and try to extract the best of my potential and do something meaninful, which meant often sacrificing pleasure and comfort to achieve my goals. At the time of writing, I feel that I am somehow living a mix of both lives. 

I've reached a point where I enjoy a comfortable living in a developed country and have a "steady job". This is very good and I believe a lot of people would feel happy and content, don't get me wrong, but I currently don't have the feeling of fullfilment I thought I would at this point. I feel that I have not impacted anyones life how I would like and that at my current job I am no different than almost every other employee, following the usual circle of life and the daily routine of most people (sleep, work, gym, eat, repeat). And this feeling brought me to the decision of creating this blog.  

At the age I am now, the feeling of "I could be doing more" is as strong as ever. I want to start helping people by sharing content that I find relevant and also learn new things and subjects. I plan to write about anything that I find interesting: technology, philosophy, politics, history, science or anything that comes to my mind. I will group the projects so it is easy to find a specific topic.

This `Who am I` section is bound to change over time as I will (hopefully) also change in the years to come. 

**I hope you enjoyed this brief reading and that you enjoy even more the content.** ðŸ˜„

#### AI Usage disclaimer

I will try to use AI the least while writing new posts, specially the personal ones. I believe AI highly influences how we think and limits our creativity, while also making extremely boring to perform a lot of tasks. This means that any sentence written here will have come initially solely from my own mind. 

**I will use AI to improve my content and deliver a better message**
